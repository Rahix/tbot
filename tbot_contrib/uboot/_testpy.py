                # pre-configured elsewhere (or configured here manually)
                build_dir = h.workdir / "u-boot-mainline"

                # subshell for the build environment
                with h.subshell():
                    # setup toolchain
                    h.env("CROSS_COMPILE", "arm-linux-")

                    )

    As shown above, the testcase will attempt to instanciate the default board
    machine from :py:class:`tbot.role.Board` and
    :py:class:`tbot.role.BoardUBoot`.  If a different board machine should be
    used, it can be passed in explicitly like this:

    .. code-block:: python

                build_dir = ...
                ...

                # for demonstration - this is exactly what uboot.testpy()
                # would do on its own when board and uboot are not passed.
                b = cx.request(tbot.role.Board)
                ub = cx.request(tbot.role.BoardUBoot, exclusive=True)

                uboot.testpy(
                    build_dir,

                    boardenv=BOARDENV,
                )

    It is advisable to request the U-Boot machine with ``exclusive=True`` so no
    other code will attempt interacting with it while testpy is running. This
    is not a hard requirement, though.

    :param tbot.machine.linux.Path uboot_sources: Path to the U-Boot sources on
        the host where test/py should run.  This could, for example, be your
        build-host.  Importantly, before calling ``testpy()``, you must ensure
        that these U-Boot sources have been configured appropriately for your
        board.  ``testpy()`` will make no attempt to do this itself.
    :param tbot.role.Board board:  Optional board machine if requesting
        :py:class:`tbot.role.Board` is not enough.  ``uboot`` must also be
        passed if ``board`` is passed.
    :param tbot.role.BoardUBoot uboot:  Optional U-Boot machine if requesting
        :py:class:`tbot.role.BoardUBoot` is not enough.  ``board`` must also be
        passed if ``uboot`` is passed.
    :param str boardenv: Optional "boardenv" file contents to configure
        test/py.  This can, for example, be used to configure where mmc tests
        can perform test reads.  The individual test implementations in the
        U-Boot sources document available options.
    :param list(str) testpy_args: Optional additional args to be passed to the
        test/py invocation.  For example, you can use ``["-k", "mmc"]`` to
        filter for mmc tests only.  Or ``["-v"]`` to show the names of all
        testcases as they are executed (or skipped).
    :param tbot.machine.linux.Path uboot_builddir: Optional path to the U-Boot
        build directory when an out-of-tree build is used.  In this case, the
        U-Boot configuration must be located in the ``uboot_builddir`` instead
        of the ``uboot_sources`` directory, of course.
