            It is strongly advised to use key authentication.  If you use password
            auth, **THE PASSWORD WILL BE LEAKED** and **MIGHT EASILY BE STOLEN**
            by other users on your labhost.  It will also be visible in the log file.

            If you decide to use this, you're doing this on your own risk.

            The only case where I support using passwords is when connecting to
            a test board with a default password.
